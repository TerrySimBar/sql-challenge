<br>

#### Requirements & Dependencies
- PostgreSQL database server
- pgAdmin or any other compatible SQL query tool
- The appropriate CSV files
<br>

#### Project Structure
- **Database Setup:** The project starts with creating a database schema in a Jupyter Notebook file, and then executed step-by-step in a pgAdmin 4 query tool. The schema defines tables and relationships to load the provided data, as shown below:
